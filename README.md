olneH there! That means hi üëç 

## About Me
I'm Home, a student passionate about all things programming. I'm also a writer, but that's kind of irrelevant information on this site.  
I've got multiple projects in the works, mainly my Discord Bot Scribble, and my web-game [Firebush]((https://firebush.netlify.app/)).   
Currently am learning SQL and more about algorithms.  
Ask me about Discord Bot programming, those things were my first steps into non-block code programming.  
You can reach me through discord, tadingo.  

## Projects

Let's look more into my projects

### Scribble

[Scribble](https://replit.com/@Home9634red/Scribble?v=1) was the first ever Discord Bot I created, using Javascript and hosting it on Replit. Due to it being my first bot, it has a lot of speghatti code, but it's still my child :)  
[If you're curious about what my Discord Bot does, you can join [this Discord server]((https://discord.gg/Bb5zm4AgPP)) and do e!help to find out more about it]

### Firebush

üî•[Firebush](https://firebush.netlify.app/) is a text simulator based off of a YouTube Minecraft seires. But you don't need to know the context. This is the first game I developed using not only Javascript, but HTML and CSS as well.
